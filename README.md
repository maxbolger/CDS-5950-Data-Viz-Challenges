This repository consists of content produced for my Computational Data Science Capstone course such as weekly data viz challenges and my final project. My goal for this class was to really emphasize writing clean, tidy, and well-documented code.

## Week 1: US Broadband Access

This week utilized data from [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-05-11/readme.md), and we were tasked with creating one choropleth map and one non-map viz. For my map I visualized broadband access by county and learned a lot about the intricacies of the plotly api in order to make advanced customizations. As for my non-map viz, I decided to get creative. I calculated the standard deviation of broadband access across counties for each state, took the top 10, and made a bar chart. Then, I created single state choropleth maps for each of these 10 states and plotted them on their according bar. I also added a color bar for reference.
